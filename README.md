# dotnet-js

Running C#/F# code in Node.js or Browser.

Entirely based on the excellent works of:
- @chrisdunelm https://github.com/chrisdunelm/DotNetAnywhere
- @SteveSanderson https://github.com/SteveSanderson/Blazor
- and contributors

Notes:
- F# support is still a work in progress (some things are crashing).
- using dotnet core 2.0 preview 2 (2.0 needed for F#, can go lower for C#)
- use build.cmd to build, VSCode to edit/run (optional)
- runs in Node.js or browser (`npm start` starts a server for browser)
